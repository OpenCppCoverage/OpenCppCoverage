# OpenCppCoverage

OpenCppCoverage is an open source code coverage tool for C++ under Windows.

- **Support optimized build**.
- **Exclude a line based on a regular expression**.
- **Child processes coverage**.
- **Coverage aggregation**: Run several code coverages and merge them into a single report.
 
## Requirements
- Windows Vista or higher.
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or higher all editions **including Express edition**. It should also work with previous version of Visual Studio.
